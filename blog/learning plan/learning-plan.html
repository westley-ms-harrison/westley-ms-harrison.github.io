      *What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      <br>
      <br>
      my long term goal is to one day own a business that brings together the different sectors of tech into one place but is still accesible to the public
      <br>
      <br>
      *A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:
      <br>
      <br>
      my limitations in learning is my attention span and need to have a more practicle oriented learning,
      as i learn and understand different concepts better when i can actively apply them rather then just pure theory.
      <br>
      <br>
      my strengths are being adaptable to whatever situatuion i'm placed in and also my ability to multi-task as it allows me to both understand the theory while applying it in a practicle sense.
      <br>
      <br>
      *What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
      <br>
      <br>
     i would like to learn more leadership and team oriented skills as that would not only allow to grow what knowledge i already have but would also allow me to apply them to a new field and group of people.
      <br>
      <br>
      *A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      <br>
      <br>
      i)An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:
      <br>
      i would set timeframes and working hours for myself, as well as break times. setting up these plans would allow to continue to have a workflow that matches that
      of real work places, while also allowing me to grow my interpersonal skills.
      <br>
      <br>
      ii)What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:
      <br>
      <br>
      i would take short breaks and do something else that might be easier or simply removing myself and coming back to it later with a calmer mind,
      which typically helps me to problem solve more effectively.
      <br>
      <br>
      *A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      <br>
      <br>
      i'm not one who is shy or afraid to ask for help but i do prefer to run through other options first,
      but if i do feel myself becoming unable to work or move forward then i would easily ask for assistance.
      <br>
      <br>
      *A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:
      <br>
      <br>
      just an open communication line and active times to speak to students who need help.
      <br>
      <br>
      *Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
      <br>
      <br>
      for myself its generally after 5pm and sundays, as i do dinners at night plus i have church on sunday and save that day for family time.
