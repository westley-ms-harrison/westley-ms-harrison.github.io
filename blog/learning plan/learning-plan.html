        <h2>*What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      </section>
      my long term goal is to one day own a business that brings together the different sectors of tech into one place but is still accesible to the public
      <br>
      <section>
        <h3>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>
      </section>
      My short term goal is to find a job within the industry and continue my growth and learning while using my skills to complete whatever work is given to me.
      <br>
      In terms of impact and destination i'm not to sure. I want to be able to work through the different levels of a job quickly
      and to improve where ever i am placed but i dont have a specific destination in mind at this point.
      <section>
        <h2>*A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h2>
      </section>
      my limitations in learning is my attention span and need to have a more practicle oriented learning,
      as i learn and understand different concepts better when i can actively apply them rather then just pure theory.
      <br> 
      <br>
      my strengths are being adaptable to whatever situatuion i'm placed in and also my ability to multi-task as it allows me to both understand the theory while applying it in a practicle sense.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h3>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h3>
      </section>
      I think a new limitation that i've found is that it is hard for me to ask for help as i have a bit to much ego and want to figure it our myself.
      a part of that is i don't want to inconvenience another person especially if they're busy.
      <br>
      A new strength would be i have a better understanding of when i'm starting to get frustrated and pacing myself an my work better.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      </section>
      The balence between my life on campus and my home life, as i have a lot of sickly members of my family so just being able to look after them while keeping on top of everything else.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
      </section>
     i would like to learn more leadership and team oriented skills as that would not only allow to grow what knowledge i already have but would also allow me to apply them to a new field and group of people.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h3>At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?</h3>
      </section>
      I would still like to learn leadership skills but i would also like to develope skills around team working and asking for help as i feel not having those is holding me back a lot.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
      </section>
      i)An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:
      <br>
      i would set timeframes and working hours for myself, as well as break times. setting up these plans would allow to continue to have a workflow that matches that
      of real work places, while also allowing me to grow my interpersonal skills.
      <br>
      <br>
      ii)What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:
      <br>
      <br>
      i would take short breaks and do something else that might be easier or simply removing myself and coming back to it later with a calmer mind,
      which typically helps me to problem solve more effectively.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      </section>
      i'm not one who is shy or afraid to ask for help but i do prefer to run through other options first,
      but if i do feel myself becoming unable to work or move forward then i would easily ask for assistance.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
      </section>
      just an open communication line and active times to speak to students who need help.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
      </section>
      <br>
      for myself its generally after 5pm and sundays, as i do dinners at night plus i have church on sunday and save that day for family time.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      </section>
      I don't have any right now, i guess just being accessible and patient as i might ask some super stupid questions.
      <br>
      <section>  
        <h3>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these expectations.</h3>
      </section>
      support to me is just being around when needed and having the skills/knowledge to answer whatever questions may a rise or being able to guide people to the answer that they need.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h2>*What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      </section>
      to always be present and have an active role in my learning. To be able to work proactively for the full course duration.
      <br>
      <section>
        <h3>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h3>
      </section>
      I would first use any resources given to me including google, then i would turn to the facilitators and lastly fellow students.
