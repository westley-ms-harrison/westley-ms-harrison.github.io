        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <br>
        1) Discuss how understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity benefits people:
        <br>
        <br>
        Neuroplasticity is the science, that through the process of repeating a task or set of tasks we are able to commit it to memory.
        the reason this is an important benfit to us as individuals is that it allows us to keep learning and growing our understanding no matter how old we get, it just might take a little more time with age.
        <br>
        <br>
        2) Discuss how you might engage with the principals of Neuroplasticity for your own benefit:
        <br>
        <br>
        it is the principle that through dedicated, hard work we can achieve anything and this science is the proof of that fact,
        as it shows that by activly pursuing what we enjoy and repeatedly doing it, we steady grow better and more proficent at it as our minds commit it to memory, making it apart of us.
        <br>
        <br>
        3) what are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplasticity?
        <br>
        <br>
        one way is through repeatedly using the skill you are trying to develop and practicing it until it becomes normal, such as making it routin.
        <br>
        Another is by actively reflecting and analyzing your thoughts around the subject as it teaches our brain that it is important and continues to stimulate our thoughts around the choosen skill or task.
        <br>

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <br>
        1) Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:
        <br>
        <br>
        Growth mindset is a theory centred around the belief that intelligence and learning can be developed and improved.
        If someone has a growth mindset, they have a positive attitude towards learning and their ability to progress and achieve or in other terms they see challenges as a way to gorw ande become better instead of as a road block.
        <br>
        <br>
        2) In this exploration, did anything surprise you? change for you?
        <br>
        <br>
        For me as an individual it didn't, as i had heard about most of these terms before when going through school.
        but it was interesting learning the history of these terms and how they came to be known.
        <br>
        <br>
        3) How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        <br>
        <br>
        In most ways i already am, as i've gotten older i have learnt to enjoy the challenges of new things and having grown up playing videogames
        i was able to learn that everything is possible no matter how hard, somethings take time and others you just need to look at from a different perspective.

        <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
        <br>
        1) Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy:
        <br>
        <br>
        i think its an important reminder of the strength and power or brain has and how much the way we think inpacts everything that we do.
        <br>
        For myself in terms of my learning plan not much changes but i think its important for when you become stressed to remind yourself of what each step is teaching you and how you can grow from them.
