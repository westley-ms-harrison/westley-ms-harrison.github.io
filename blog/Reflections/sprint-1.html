      <p>
        1: Using the evidence gathered, describe your core Values:
        <br>
        <br>
        according to the Myers Briggs test i am a ISFP or Harmonizer, which means When interacting with others, i am warm, kind-hearted, and generous. It may be difficult for me to open up at first, but once i do, others are drawn to my charm.
        which i have always found to be true within my life as that even tho i can be stand offish i have never found myself lacking in friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        i: Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        <br>
        <br>
        Prior to my return to study i was a Quality Auditor for a recycling plant in Onehunga here is Auckland,
        as a part of this job i would often have to run teams of verying sizes. One time i had a young pregnant women within one of my work groups,
        who was struggling with the work provided so i was forced to decide if i should keep her in this work or move her to a different area which would result in less hours/pay for that day.
        I chose to switch her with a different worker. 2 days later she came back to me and thanked me for moving her, that even tho it was less money it was much easier on her body which allowed her to return to work the following day.
        <br>
        <br>
        ii: Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:
        A lot of my values come more from my religious background as its taught me a lot about how to respect other people, to be kind, forgiving and helpful to anyone that crosses my path
        which as a Maori has always been at the heart of my culture as well. To be freely giving of time and to always stand ready to offer a helping hand to anyone who my need it and i find that to be shown a lot in my work as i always strive to create a friendly open workspace.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        2: Using evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations:
        <br>
        <br>
        i: Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:
        My biggest weakness is my need for constant change and growth, a lot of my past jobs/education choices have been repetitve with no real changes in the way they work
        which would often just leave me bored, making it harder for me to focus on my work and would often leave me drained.
        <br>
        <br>
        my strength would be how adaptable i am to ever changing enviroments and work place structures as i find this to be more interesting and exciting rather then executing the same work process everyday.
        <br>
        <br>
        ii: Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:
        over time i have learnt how to break up my work loads and create work structures that allow me to process the work that i have without becoming bored or burnt out by the repeated process
        which has helped me with time management and meeting deadlines.
        <br>
        <br>
        iii: Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others,but there was resistance or tension.
        Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why:
        <br>
        <br>
        At my last job we had 2 workers that had a falling out, after having a review meeting of the incident with both parties, it was decided to seperate the 2 into different shifts which allowed all parties to begin working as normal again.
        <br>
        <br>
        i feel the strategy worked as it allowed for the work to flow again which at the time was the main desire. But looking back i also wish that the inital conflict was able to be resolved
        so a new strategy i would use now is to also introduce a conflict resolution schedule of meetings to help improve the damaged relationship as to avoid future conflicts within the same parties.
