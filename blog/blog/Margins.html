        All HTML is made up of different boxes
      </h1>
      <p>
        I know that might be hard to wrap your head around but everything on a webpage is just a bunch on boxes styled and changed to create a desired look/feel that is pleasing to the people viewing it aka you.
        <br>
        <br>
        below is an example of this very concept. In the middle is the content, wrapped around the content is the padding, wrapped around the padding is the margin,
        and wrapped around the margin is the border.
        <br>
        now i know you must be wondering why that matters. Well basically by using css or cascading style sheets, we can transform how these boxes react with our content.
