        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <br>
        Emotion psychology defines emotional intelligence as recognizing and understanding your emotions and those of others. 
        By using emotional understanding, you can make decisions, solve problems and communicate more effectively.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ</h2>
        <br>
        An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total score derived from a set of standardized tests or subtests designed to assess human intelligence.
        <br>
        this is different to EQ because EQ gages how we interact with other people and how we process/understanding there feelings, 
        where as IQ is how we understand and interact with informtaion that we are given such as a math problem like 1+1 or being asked to sing our A B C's.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <br>
        both are important for different reasons, our IQ shows the level of intelligence we have and our ability to process higher levels of problem solving,
        where as EQ is how we interact with those around us and how we manage working with others.
        <br>
        <br>
        without a higher level of EQ we are unable to understand another persons feelings, like when a baby is crying. The baby can't speak so we don't understand them and after enough time we begin to get angry or frustated all because we don't know why they're crying.
        <br>
        <br>
        this can also happen in professional setting when two or more people are placed into a team but because one member doesn't understand anothers feelings it leads to in fighting and a collapse in teamwork.
