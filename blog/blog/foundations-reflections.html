            <h2 class="header">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        </section>
        Reflection, Patience with self, and the need to ask for help. I'm still working on the last one.

        <section>
            <h2 class="header">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        </section>
        It's what you use when working as a team or in groups. You're values let others know what to expect from you and how to treat you.
        empathy and self awareness let us know how to treat others we are working/interacting with.

            <h2 class="header">What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h2>
            How similar so much of it is to what i've learned from church as well as randomly from my family.

        <section>
            <h2 class="header">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        </section>
        For myself its hard for me to remember to write down or constantly be reflective about what i'm doing. Also just asking for help from others as i'm use to just working through any problems i have.

        <section>
            <h2 class="header">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootcamp course?</h2>
        </section>
        Because it helps to teach us not only how to handle persoanl problems but also how to treat and work with others which are important skills when working as teams, which is a common pratice within IT.
        <br>
        <section>
            <h2 class="header">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        </section>
        No, beacuse having come from a more leadership role at my last job i've learnt that its important to have different techniques for different situations as well as understanding how to work with others
        and making sure that everyone feels heard so that if there are any conflicts its easily handled.
