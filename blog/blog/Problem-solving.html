        <p class="techniques">    
            <br>
            1: Pseudocode: Pseudocode is not actual code, but rather comments that tell you how the code will eventually look. It is informal, plainly written steps that form the rough draft or outline of your code.
            <br>
            <br>
            2: The rubber ducky method: This one is talking thorugh or explaining your code/process to an inanimate object or person without any experience in what your doing in a way that allows them to understand.
            this method works on the idea that when you can explain something so well it sounds easy then do you truly understand what you are doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            3: Reading error messages: This one is self-explanatory
            <br>
            <br>
            4: Console.logging: The console is the built-in debugger of the browser. Many developers use console.log() all the time to print messages and debug problems in their code.
            <br>
            <br>
            5: Googling: we all know this one
            <br>
            <br>
            6: Trying something: sometimes you just gotta play with the code and see what happens.
            <br>
            <br>
            7/8: Asking your peers for help/Asking your coaches or managers or whatever for help
            <br>
            <br>
            9: Improving your process with reflections: which means to look back at how you created your code and just trying to understand your choices around it.

      </section>    
      <p class="reflections">
          <br>
          I feel for myself that i need alot of work with some of these techniques as i tend to only use a handful of them.
          <br>
          The ones i tend to use the most are the 'Rubber ducky', 'Googling', 'Trying something', and 'Reading error messages'. Tho i sometimes get confused in what i am reading when it comes to the last technique.
          <br>
          <br>
          but i know and understand the importance of all of these techniques and i have begun to work on that especially when it comes to asking for help as this is incredible important when working in team projects.

          <h2 class="header">Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
          <h3>1: Got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      </section>
          a time i got blocked and sometimes still happens is when my css code stopped working.
          at the time the links to my style sheets would not connect with the html, so no matter what i did my css just would not express on the webpage.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>*what problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          the main techniques i used was googling, asking for help and reading error messages.
          <br>
          reading the error messages was i learnt that it was the actual link that was broken but the code was correct so i tried googling my problem on different websites but nothing seemed to work or help,
          i then asked my brother who is a software analist what i should try and he was unable to come up with anything.
          it wasn't until i used 'try something' that i was finally able to fix it by just deleting the code attached to css and rewriting it.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>*How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          it was frustrating as it was putting my over time and it just felt like it would not work but after finally just scrapping the link and rewriting it, it felt good to finally seeing it work.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>*What did you learn?</h3>
          i learnt to pace myself better when dealing with something that isn't working as i can often find myself often just trying to force myself to work through it,
          and that sometimes its okay to just try something different with the code since its already broken.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>2: Solved a problem in a elegant way:</h3>
          I don't feel like i've ever solved a problem in an elegant way. Most of the time when i get stuck it usually just takes a reworking of my exsiting code.
          <br>
          an example of this is during the replit kata 'Javascript Olympics', some of my code wasn't working and i couldn't figure out why so i tried rewirtting it which solved the problem above but that still didn't work.
          So i changed my code to the one in the example page and it still wouldn't work. But when i took the time to sit back and reflect i realized i just needed to add space between some of the words and suddenly it all worked and i passed the test.
          <br>
          <br>
          though i don't feel it was an elegant answer it made me use different techniques to what i had before which showed me how important it is to have different techniques for problem solving are,
          and that the more techniques we know the easier it becomes to work through problems as you can just cycle though your different techniques and options.
